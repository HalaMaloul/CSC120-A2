What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I feel like this assignment was very challenging for me and even after finishing it I don't feel like I learned much.I had no idea how to do the assignment and I asked a lot of people. Everyone else was confused and even if they had progress in their code whenever I ask a question they didn't have an answer.It was very stressful and I felt like I did not have a base to start the assignment.I prefer to be taught how to do something then practice doing it.But having to figure it out myself feels very stressful especially when learning the basics.I think I need an advice myself:(
